Version 0.3 - Oct. 21, 2017
  * Memory-saving options in extract_CpG_data.py and
    combine_CpG_sites.py (both '-b').  With this option,
    the scripts will analyze one chromosome (reference
    sequence) at a time, rather than loading/saving all
    data at once.  The input SAM must be coordinate-sorted
    for extract_CpG_data.py, and the input files must be in
    the same sort order for combine_CpG_sites.py.

Version 0.2 - June 13, 2017
  * Clarified sample names designation.

Version 0.1 - Dec 19, 2016
  * First public release on GitHub.
