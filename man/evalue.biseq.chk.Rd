\usage{
evalue.biseq.chk(
  input_filename_a,
  input_filename_b,
  sep = "\\t",
  bheader = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_filename_a}{metilene input file path. This file is a sep (e.g. TAB) separated file with two key columns and several value columns in pairs:
For exampe:

chrom    pos    g1    g1    g1    g1    g1    g1    g1    g1    g2    g2    g2    g2    g2    g2    g2    g2

chrom and pos are keys;
g1 g1 g2 g2 must be stored in pairs.}

\item{input_filename_b}{metilene input file path. This file should stored as a sep(e.g. TAB) separated file with two key columns and several value columns:
The columns are (in order):

    - chr:   Chromosome

    - start: The position of the start site of the corresponding region

    - end: The position of the end site of the corresponding region

    - range: The range of the corresponding region

    - strand: Strand

    - median.p:  The median of p-values in the corresponding region

    - median.meth.group1 : The median of methylation level for the corresponding segment of group 1

    - median.meth.group2 : The median of methylation level for the corresponding segment of group 2

    - median.meth.diff:  The median of the difference between the methylation level}

\item{sep}{separator, default is the TAB key.}

\item{bheader}{a logical value indicating whether the input_filename_b file contains the names of the variables as its first line. By default, bheader = FALSE.}
}
\value{
list(file_a, file_b, file_a_b) returns a list with three pr-handled data.frames corresponding to the input_filename_a, input_filename_b file and a A JOIN B file.
